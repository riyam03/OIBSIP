      <h3><b>Biography:</b></h3>
      <p>
        <br />
        A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born
        October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong),
        Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the
        development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was
        president of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam earned a degree in
        aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in
        1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In
        1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was
        project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that
        was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam
        planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which
        helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was
        Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which
        incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.

      <h3><b>Career Records:</b></h3>

      <p>
        From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister,
        and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
        government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the
        country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power
        and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused
        great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward
        a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as
        a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed
        society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures,
        increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a
        vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and
        education. In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put
        forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan.
        Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though
        he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even
        the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed
        his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s
        11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office
        at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the
        country’s first woman president.
